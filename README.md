SUMMARY

The goal is to build a "Repsly lunch suggestion system".

Repslyans need to have lunch and want to try new things. We want to have a suggestion of where to go for lunch, for each of our offices. And since we're scattered around the world, it is interesting to know if it's sunny there or if it's raining.

We want to have a list with every Repsly location in the world, and for each of them a single nearby restaurant suggestion, with average review and current weather conditions in that area. We want this list in CSV format, uploaded in the AWS S3 bucket and publicly available for download.

We have bigger plans for this service; to make it part of the initiative to bring all Repsly locations closer. For that purpose, please prepare it for the internal technical team to take over. On top of working code please provide a detailed description of the solution suitable for handover to the other team.
